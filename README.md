<h2>UX</h2>
<p>The idea behind this project was to give Gaudi lovers a chance to cram in as much archutecture in one day as they could when having the opertunity of being in Barcelona.
I personally have never been to Barcelona but would love to one day to get the oppertinity to see Gaudis work like this page gives the oppertinity to, It has 
some information on the buildings and information of Gaudi for people who arrive on the page non the wiser of him. So if they look for Gaudi's arcutechture</p>

The end user of this project is people who have a keen interest in Art and Arctutecure. The users would range from any age. It will be used mainly on mobile and tablet devices going by the technology used in this day and age but can also be accesable through desktop comfertably.

The end user want's to see information on Antoni Gaudi himself and his work.

The benefit of the project is to show of the Gaudi buldings in an inviting way with bright colours and a user friendly style just like some of the mosaic on the budilings to admire his famous buidlings in real life.

Other features that are to note is the user can get intouch  easily by navigation to the social links.

<h3>Testing and Bugs</h3>

<p>At the begining of this project I knew what I wanted it to look like, 
I unfortunetly focused on Desktop screen more that Mobile this meant that the 3 card images that are click-able with 
the 3 buildings were supposed to grow in size I later found out that when being selected they were moving the titles 
of the images and the about section with Gaudi. To fix this I removed the groth as it didn't work well with tablet or
mobile and applied a opacity blur ot the images which looks alot better.

The Contact form when you submit it it doesn't actually submit the form, I found this out via Dev tools on the Google Chrome.

I also came to learn the smooth scrolling behaviour I had implamened for a smooth transaction between the navigation bar
and the images wasn't working on most browesers. but I have kept it for better UX when on tablets/mobiles.

This was used on a number of occasions to find bugs with my code and missing items this was found on Dev tools and code verifier.</p>
