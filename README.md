<h2>UX</h2>
<p>The idea behind this project was to give Gaudi lovers a chance to cram in as much archutecture in one day as they could when having the opertunity of being in Barcelona.
I personally have never been to Barcelona but would love to one day to get the oppertinity to see Gaudis work like this page gives the oppertinity to, It has 
some information on the buildings and information of Gaudi for people who arrive on the page non the wiser of him. So if they look for Gaudi's arcutechture</p>

The end user of this project is people who have a keen interest in Art and Arctutecure. The users would range from any age. It will be used mainly on mobile and tablet devices going by the technology used in this day and age but can also be accesable through desktop comfertably.
